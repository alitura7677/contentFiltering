The free-fall time is the characteristic time that would take a body to collapse under its own gravitational attraction , if no other forces existed to oppose the collapse . As such , it plays a fundamental role in setting the timescale for a wide variety of astrophysical processesfrom star formation to helioseismology to supernovaein which gravity plays a dominant role . # Derivation # # Infall to a point source of gravity # It is relatively simple to derive the free-fall time by applying nothing more than Kepler 's Third Law of planetary motion to a degenerate elliptic orbit . Consider a point mass  m  a distance  R  from a point source of mass  M  which falls radially inward to it . Crucially , Kepler 's Third Law depends only on the semi-major axis of the orbit , and does not depend on the eccentricity . A purely radial trajectory is an example of a degenerate ellipse with an eccentricity of 1 and semi-major axis  R/2  . Therefore , the time it would take a body to fall inward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the same as the period of a circular orbit of radius  R/2  , or :  torbit = frac2 pisqrt G(M+m) **27;107995;TOOLONG R3/2sqrt2 G(M+m) .  To see that the semi-major axis is  R/2  , we must examine properties of orbits as they become increasingly elliptical . Kepler 's First Law states that an orbit is an ellipse with the center of mass as one focus . In the case of a very small mass falling toward a very large mass  M  , the center of mass is within the larger mass . The focus of an ellipse is increasingly off-center with increasing ellipticity . In the limiting case of a degenerate ellipse with an eccentricity of 1 , the orbit extends from the initial position of the infalling object (  R  ) to the point source of mass  M  . In other words , the ellipse becomes a line of length  R  . The semi-major axis is half the width of the ellipse along the long axis , which in the degenerate case becomes  R/2  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would begin at distance  R  from the point source mass  M  , fall inward until it reached that point source , then turn around and journey back to its original position . In real systems , the point source mass is n't truly a point source and the infalling body eventually collides with some surface . Thus , it only completes half the orbit . But since the infalling part of the orbit is symmetric to the hypothetical outgoing portion of the orbit , we can simply divide the period of the full orbit by two to attain the free-fall time ( the time along the infalling portion of the orbit ) . :  tff=torbit/2 = fracpi2 fracR3/2 sqrt2 G(M+m)  This formula also follows from the formula for the falling time as a function of position . Note that  torbit  in the above equation , is the time for the mass to fall in a highly eccentric orbit , make a hairpin turn at the central mass at nearly zero radius distance , and then returns to R when it repeats the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion back and from distance R to distance 0 . As noted above , this orbit has only half as long a semimajor axis ( R/2 ) as a circular orbit with radius R ( where the semimajor axis is R ) , and thus the period for the shorter high-eccentricity orbit is that for one with an axis of R/2 and a total orbital pathlength of only twice the infall distance . Thus , by Kepler 's third law , with half the semimajor axis radius it thus takes only ( 1/2 )  3/2  = ( 1/8 )  1/2  as long a time period , as the corresponding circular orbit that has a constant radius the same as the maximal radius of the eccentric orbit ( which goes to essentially zero radius from the primary at its other extreme ) . The time to traverse half the distance R , which is the infall time from R along an eccentric orbit , is the Kepler time for a circular orbit of R/2 ( not R ) , which is ( 1/32 )  1/2  times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For example , the time for an object in the orbit of the Earth around the Sun , to fall into the Sun if it were suddenly stopped in orbit , would be  P/sqrt32  , where P is one year . This is about 64.6 days . # Infall of a spherically-symmetric distribution of mass # Now , consider a case where the mass  M  is not a point mass , but is distributed in a spherically-symmetric distribution about the center , with an average mass density of  rho  , :  rho = frac3 M4 pi R3  , where the volume of a sphere is :  ( 4/3 ) pi R3 .  Let us assume that the only force acting is gravity . Then , as first demonstrated by Newton , and can easily be demonstrated using the divergence theorem , the acceleration of gravity at any given distance  R  from the center of the sphere depends only upon the total mass contained within  R  . The consequence of this result is that if one imagined breaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each shell would collapse only subsequent to the shells interior to it , and no shells cross during collapse . As a result , the free-fall time of a massless particle at  R  can be expressed solely in terms of the total mass  M  interior to it . In terms of the average density interior to  R  , :  tff = frac14sqrt frac3 pi2 G rhosimeq 0.5427 frac1 sqrt G rhosimeq 66430 , rm s frac1 sqrt rho  where the latter is in SI units . This result is exactly the same as from the previous section when :  M gg m  . # Applications # The free-fall time is a very useful estimate of the relevant timescale for a number of astrophysical processes . To get a sense of its application , we may write :  tff simeq frac35 , mboxminsqrtrho cdot sqrtfracmboxgmboxcm3 .  Here we have estimated the numerical value for the free-fall time as roughly 35 minutes for a body of mean density 1 g/cm  3  . # Comparison # For an object falling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes from a given position to fall to the central point mass is the same as the free-fall time , except for a constant  frac43pi  0.42.
