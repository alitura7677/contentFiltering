Preamble Phoenix Corp has developed an online dating service. Phoenix Corp therefore provides an online platform to visitors, where they can communicate amongst them and therefore plays the role of technical service provider.

The service is exclusively reserved to members registered on the platform in compliance with the present rules. 2. Prerequisites The members confirm having received all necessary documentation on the proposed services from Phoenix Corp and comply without reservation to the present service terms and conditions.

'account': space of the platform reserved to members. 'member': any person who completed the registration process on the platform. 'platform': all the information systems for providing the services to the public. It consists of the back office and the database of members and subscribers. 'service': service and additional services proposed by Phoenix Corp, accessible online on a website supported by the platform. 4. Objective The objective of the present document is to define the conditions of use of the services proposed by Phoenix Corp. 5. Contractual documents The mandatory contractual documents for members are: The present service terms and conditions; The data-processing and liberties rules of service; The ethical charter of the service. In case of contradiction between documents of different nature or rank, it is explicitly agreed between the parties that the provisions of higher rank contained in the document shall prevail for obligations in a conflict of interpretation.

Rank criteria will be applied according to the following principles: Obligation by obligation; Or failing that, paragraph by paragraph; Or failing that article by article. 6. Opposability The present terms and conditions are opposable as soon as they are accepted by the member when subscribing to the service. Phoenix Corp reserves the right to modify the present terms and conditions as it considers necessary and useful. It shall do its utmost to inform members of the existence and date of application of new terms and conditions. Any use of the service by the member within 30 days after a modification of the terms and conditions confirms the latter accepts those new terms and conditions. The member may end using the service but remains responsible for any anterior use. Members can access archived terms of use upon request by e-mail at: customer@cougar-rencontre.net The online terms and conditions on the platform prevail on any earlier printed version. 7. Registration to the Service 7.1 Registration Access to the Service is reserved to persons registered on the platform. To open an account and become a member, the user must previously register via the online form on the platform. Two registration procedures are available: Registration via facebook connect; Registration via online form. 7.2 Registration via facebook connect To facilitate the service registration process, the user can use the identification information of his/her natural person facebook account and entering its username and password. With the facebook connect application the fields to be completed will be automatically filled with the information taken from the user facebook account, under his sole responsibility. The use of the facebook connect application is a simple technical feature provided to the user to facilitate his/her registration and complete the registration fields for the service: facebook connect is a third party service to the service and Phoenix Corp does not in any way guarantee the correct operation and reliability of the information obtained through that application. No information on the registration to the service will be displayed on the facebook account of the user. 7.3 Registration via online form The service registration procedure via the online form on the platform consists of the following steps: Step 1: the user completes a registration form by completing the required fields - some are mandatory - depending on the services selected by the user. Some requested information builds the user profile and can be accessed by other members of the service: they must be correct and regularly updated. Step 2: the user acknowledges and accepts the terms and conditions of the service by ticking the appropriate box; if the user does not accept the service terms and conditions, he/she shall stop the registration process and immediately leave the platform; Step 3: once the profile is correctly informed, the user validates the form and receives a confirmation email at the supplied email address. Once the user has confirmed the registration, he/she becomes a member of the service subject to formal acceptance of the present terms and conditions. 7.4 Subscription via mobile application The purchase platforms of mobile applications for mobile phones, digital tablets or any other digital communication device connected to the internet enable downloading an application dedicated to the use of the platform. Members wishing to use it must therefore have a connection to mobile internet. This application enables subscription to the service from a mobile phone for example. It also enables subscription to paying functions. The services subscribed from a mobile application in integrated purchase are subject to the present terms and conditions, as well as the terms and conditions of the purchase platform for mobile applications to obtain the application, the invoicing conditions, the payment and renewal terms of the service(s). It also means that an account must be created on that platform to enable the application download. 7.5 Profiles on hold As soon as the service is subscribed to, the member profile is displayed as 'pending': during that variable period, the member profile is checked by Phoenix Corp to ascertain that the data and information supplied by the member meet the present terms and conditions and the ethical charter of the service. Finally, the user is offered the exclusive power to multiply his chances of finding love through the orientation on other sites if already registered or wants more contact. If the terms and conditions are not complied with, the member is informed by email of the rejection of the profile and is proposed to modify it. If the member does not modify the profile in comformity with the terms and conditions Phoenix Corp reserves the right to definitively refuse it. Acceptance of the profile does not validate its content, nor does it mean Phoenix Corp recognises its lawfulness. 8. Financial terms 8.1 Service In order to enable members discovering the functions of the service, access to a limited version of the service is offered free of charge to discover some functions of the platform. The free access does not enable the use of all the functions of the platform or to meet other members. Women wishing to be placed in contact with a man will specially receive free and complete access to the service, with the exception of additional services which remain payable. In all cases where access is free, either partial or total, Phoenix Corp reserves the right to modify it both for conditions of access and financial terms of the service. Except in the above cases, access to the service is payable. The member subscribes to the service for the selected duration by the member, at the online price at the time of subscription and according to the payment methods proposed by Phoenix Corp and selected by the member.

Access to the Service is immediate if payment is made by bank card. A processing period is required if payment is made by cheque or bank transfer. In that second hypothesis and when the service is unavailable to the member after a period of fourteen (14) days from the sending of the cheque by mail or the bank transfer, it is recommended to the member to send a message to customer services by means of the form accessible from his/her account via the 'Help' menu. Phoenix Corp reserves the right to propose temporary promotional offers to new members or existing subscribed members for a certain time. The proposed financial terms are exceptional and cannot be grounds for any complaint by the other members.
