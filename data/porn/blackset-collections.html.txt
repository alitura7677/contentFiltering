OVERVIEW The Fleshlight rewards program (the Ã¢ÂÂProgramÃ¢ÂÂ) is a loyalty reward program offered by Interactive Life Forms, LLC (the Ã¢ÂÂCompanyÃ¢ÂÂ, Ã¢ÂÂusÃ¢ÂÂ, Ã¢ÂÂourÃ¢ÂÂ or Ã¢ÂÂweÃ¢ÂÂ) to certain customers of the Company. The Program is accessible through www.fleshlight.com (the Ã¢ÂÂProgram WebsiteÃ¢ÂÂ) and any other related sites and applications referred to on the Program Website including without limitation: www.fleshlight.com/pages/loyalty-program-terms/ (the Ã¢ÂÂExplainer PageÃ¢ÂÂ). The Program allows persons who have completed the membership enrollment steps (each, a Ã¢ÂÂProgram MemberÃ¢ÂÂ or Ã¢ÂÂMemberÃ¢ÂÂ) in accordance with the present Terms and Conditions to collect points when making purchases on items identified from time to time by the Company (Ã¢ÂÂEligible PurchasesÃ¢ÂÂ), and to redeem these points for rewards, benefits and/or rebates offered by the Company from time to time. Members acquire no vested right or entitlement to the continued availability of any particular reward, benefit or redemption level. 1.2. TERMS AND CONDITIONS The terms and conditions set forth herein (the Ã¢ÂÂTerms & ConditionsÃ¢ÂÂ, and together with any terms set forth on the Program Website, the Explainer Page, the Program WebsiteÃ¢ÂÂs privacy policy and any other terms accessible through any of the foregoing, collectively the Ã¢ÂÂProgram TermsÃ¢ÂÂ) govern the Program. The Company in its sole discretion can, restrict, suspend, amend, extend or otherwise alter the Program Terms at any time and without prior notice. If the Program Terms have been updated, the Company will post the new Program Terms on the Program Website and note the date that they were last updated, and no change will be effective until such change has been posted for at least ten (10) days. We encourage Members to review the Program Terms each time they use the Program. 1.3. ACCEPTANCE By using or enrolling in the Program, you accept and agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions. 2. PROGRAM MEMBERSHIP 2.1. MEMBERSHIP ENROLLMENT Membership is free and no initial purchase is required in order to become a Member. To become a valid Member, you must complete the enrolment process by providing complete and accurate information and indicating your acceptance of the Program Terms. After completion, you will receive a rewards member number (Ã¢ÂÂMember NumberÃ¢ÂÂ). 2.2. PASSWORDS AND SECURITY In order to enroll in the Program, you will have to register and create an Account with us and provide one or more names, email addresses, login usernames and passwords (together, Ã¢ÂÂIDÃ¢ÂÂ). You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your ID. You agree not to use the ID of any third party or disclose your ID to any third party. You are responsible for any and all activity that occurs on your Account, whether or not such use and related liabilities were in any way authorized by you, and it is your responsibility to safeguard any access control mechanisms you may have related to your Account such as a password or ID. If you suspect any unauthorized use of your Account, you must notify us immediately. You agree to provide us with correct and complete Account information at all times and inform us of any changes to the information you have provided. We will keep your ID confidential. Only one Fleshlight rewards program rewards account (Ã¢ÂÂAccountÃ¢ÂÂ) is permitted per person. 2.3. SUSPENSION RIGHTS; CAPACITY If the Company determines that a Program Member has abused any of the ProgramÃ¢ÂÂs privileges, fails to comply with any of the Program Terms, or makes any misrepresentation to the Company the Company may, in its sole discretion, take such actions as it deems appropriate, including without limitation, suspending such MemberÃ¢ÂÂs privileges under the Program, revoking any or all of the points in such Program MemberÃ¢ÂÂs Account, and/or revoking the Program MemberÃ¢ÂÂs membership in the Program, in each case, with or without advance notice to the Member and without liability to the Company. Points will not be awarded if in the CompanyÃ¢ÂÂs reasonable opinion the merchandise purchased will be used for resale or commercial use and any points awarded on such purchases will be forfeited. If a Member was awarded points for an offer or promotion in which a Member purchased product(s) in excess of reasonable quantities, the points awarded as a result of that offer or promotion may be forfeited without prior notice and the Account may be suspended or closed. Unless further restricted elsewhere in the Program Terms, Membership is only available to (i) individuals above the age of majority and who have legal capacity, and (ii) corporations, businesses, charities, partnerships, enterprises, schools or anyone other than an individual, provided that such entity has legal capacity and has duly authorized such Membership. If a Member does not meet the capacity requirements set out above, all points awarded to such Member may be forfeited without prior notice and the Account may be suspended or closed. 2.4. CHANGE IN INFORMATION Program Members are responsible to advise the Company immediately of any change to their address or other contact information. ÃÂ The Company will not be responsible for any communication not received by a Program Member, provided that the Company sent such communication to the address or other contact information then on file from such Program Member. 2.5. INACTIVE ACCOUNTS A Program Member Account is deemed to be inactive if points are not earned in connection with such Account for 12 months. Once an Account is deemed to be inactive, all points in such Account may, in the CompanyÃ¢ÂÂs sole discretion, be deemed to have been forfeited by such Member, with or without notice. ÃÂ 2.6. ACCOUNT CLOSURE Points are reduced to zero upon closure of a Membership. 2.7. SECURITY If a Membership Number is used by any other person, all points relating to purchases made by such other person will be credited to the MemberÃ¢ÂÂs Account. The Company assumes no liability or responsibility for points redeemed by any person(s) prior to a notification to the CompanyÃ¢ÂÂs Customer Service Centre that the Membership Number has been compromised. Any points redeemed prior to notification shall be at the MemberÃ¢ÂÂs risk. 3. REWARD POINTS 3.1. COLLECTION; REDEMPTION Points can be earned by Program Members in connection with purchases of goods and/or services made through the Company (whether online and/or from physical locations) as set forth on the Explainer Page, regardless of method of payment, provided that the Membership Number is presented/entered at the time of purchase. ÃÂ Points can be redeemed for rewards. When enough points have been accumulated to obtain the reward(s) desired, redemption may occur through online and/or physical locations as set forth on the Program website or Explainer Page. ÃÂ The redemption schedule, available rewards and other information is available on the Explainer Page. ÃÂ A Member must provide his/her Membership Number when redeeming points to protect the integrity of the MemberÃ¢ÂÂs points balance. Each Member is responsible to ensure that all Personal Information is correct and up-to-date and the Company reserves the right to block redemptions where the Member information is inaccurate or incomplete. Members are solely and entirely responsible for keeping their Account secure. ÃÂ If a purchase price is lower than the redemption value of the points, the remaining dollar value associated with all utilized points will be forfeited. 3.2. VALUE Points have no cash value and are not exchangeable for cash, that no interest is paid or earned with respect to points, that points are not personal property, that the quantity of points in your Account may be increased or decreased by the Company in its sole and absolute discretion for any reason or no reason whatsoever, that you have no right to a refund related to points, that there is no right to transfer or exchange points, and that the Company may limit your license to use points with respect to any goods and/or services or time period related thereto. You further acknowledge that additional restrictions related to points, as determined in the sole and absolute discretion of the Company, may be applicable if, and when, points are made available to you or thereafter. The Company may restrict the award or use of points based on your country of residence or other factors. The accumulation of points does not entitle the Program Members to any vested rights, and the Company does not guarantee in any way the continued availability of any reward, redemption level, rebate or any other benefit. The Company assumes no liability to Members as regards the addition or deletion of items from or for which points can be collected and/or redeemed. You are responsible for any taxes that may result from your participation in the Program. 3.3 TRANSFERABILITY Except as permitted from time to time by the Company, points cannot be assigned, exchanged, traded, bartered, purchased or given by gift or otherwise sold. Any points so acquired are void. ÃÂ For the avoidance of doubt, such prohibited transfers include transfers upon operation or law upon the death of a Member. 3.4. RETURN/EXCHANGE POLICY In the event of a return/exchange of any eligible purchase that initially earned points, such points will be deducted automatically from the Account that was used for the eligible purchase (whether or not the Membership Number is presented at the time of return and/or exchange). Points will be deducted at the same rate as they were earned. Upon the return and/or exchange of products awarded through the redemption of points, all redeemed points will be forfeited. 3.5. PROMOTION From time to time, the Company may advertise or offer exclusive offers to select Members to redeem points for items other than a discount reward, or receive other benefits or discounts. 4. PRIVACY 4.1. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION The Company respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your privacy.

HOW TO USE YOUR FLESHPUMP VIEW PDF Practice makes perfect Ã¢ÂÂ it might take time to get used to the feel and functionality of the FleshPump, so please take time to read affiliated instruction manuals and allow yourself patience to experiment and see how FleshPump can work best with your body. Practice the technique of creating and maintaining your erection before attempting sexual intercourse with another person. Assure your FleshPump Ã¢ÂÂdonutÃ¢ÂÂ is clean and free of lint or residue. Lubricate your flaccid penis generously with an oil-based lube such as FleshPump Lubricant. To prevent pulling of pubic hair, lubricate the base of the body or remove pubic hair around the base of the penis. Place your flaccid penis at the opening of the FleshPump Ã¢ÂÂdonut.Ã¢ÂÂ Press the vacuum button to slowly draw your lubricated flaccid penis into the pump tube. This will help create a snug seal at the base of the body. Keep the pump steady with one hand and use the other to operate the vacuum. As you pump, watch your penis respond to the gradual vacuum pressure and pay attention to how it feels. It is normal for your penis to turn red as a result of blood being drawn into the shaft. Pumping too fast may bruise or cause rupture of the blood vessels below the skin, so please take it slow. If pain or discomfort persists, immediately stop and release the vacuum. Seek medical attention if necessary. For best results, pump in short 5-10 second bursts and then release the suction, similarly to how you might work out muscles at the gym. Average duration of pumping sessions is 3-5 minutes total. You must wait 60 minutes between FleshPump uses. CAUTION: CONSULT YOUR PHYSICIAN OR MEDICAL CARE PROFESSIONAL IF ANY COMPLICATIONS OCCUR. DISCONTINUE USE OF THE FLESHPUMP IF ANY COMPLICATIONS PERSIST.Interactive Life Forms, LLC (Ã¢ÂÂILFÃ¢ÂÂ) and its affiliates are dedicated to limiting the spread of diseases from sharing or using another personÃ¢ÂÂs products. Once this product is opened, it is non-returnable. COMPLETELY READ AND UNDERSTAND THE INSTRUCTIONS (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ALL PRECAUTIONS AND WARNINGS) PRIOR TO USING THE FLESHPUMP. The FleshPump is designed to assist men in obtaining an erection before intercourse. FLESHPUMP IS NOT INTENDED TO BE WORN OR USED TO PENETRATE YOUR PARTNER. YOU MAY CAUSE HARM TO YOURSELF OR YOUR PARTNER. PRECAUTIONS/WARNINGS: The FleshPump is made from body-safe polycarbonate/TPE and is generally safe for personal body contact. Putting the FleshPump in contact with another personÃ¢ÂÂs body and/or uids is not advised due to the possibility of spreading communicable diseases. The following precautionary measures are advised when using the FleshPump: The FleshPump may not be safe for men who do not feel pain on the penis and its surrounding area. As the FleshPump may cause sexual arousal with increased heart and respiration rates, persons should consult their physician or medical professional before using the FleshPump and/or if you su er from any of the following: heart or lung disease; high blood pressure; stroke, epilepsy or convulsive disorder; genital or urinary disorder (e.g. kidney, bladder, testicular or penile problems or issues); diabetes or if you take anti-coagulants, large quantities of aspirin or other blood thinners; if you have sickle cell disease, bleeding disorders or leukemia; or you have a history of prolonged erections. This product is intended for use by a single person. Consult your physician or medical professional before using the FleshPump or if you (i) have reduced sensation in the genital area or experience other genitalia issues or (ii) experience discomfort during or after use. If at any time you experience pain or discomfort, immediately stop using the FleshPump and consult a physician or medical professional as soon as possible for advice. The wearer must be in control of the FleshPump at all times. Avoid falling asleep while using the FleshPump or using the FleshPump while under the in uence of drugs or alcohol. You may not feel pain while you are using drugs or alcohol. If your hands are severely impaired, you should not use this product. You must have full use of both of your hands to safely use the FleshPump, with the strength to operate the vacuum release mechanism. Avoid the testicles coming in contact with the vacuum-sealing area to avoid discomfort; try taking a warm shower or bath to relax the genitals prior to using the FleshPump. Wait 60 minutes between uses. Failure to do so may injure the penis. You can severely bruise or damage your penis if you do not wait at least 60 minutes between uses of the FleshPump. Disable the vacuum if severe pain occurs. Pain may be a sign the penis is bruising. Never try to withdraw the penis from the FleshPump without rst pressing the vacuum release valve. Withdrawing of the penis without the vacuum release may cause harm. It is possible that using the FleshPump may bruise or break blood vessels either immediately below the skin or deep within the penis shaft or scrotum. Internal bleeding, bruising or petechiae (small purplish spots on a body surface, such as the skin or mucous membrane, caused by a minute hemorrhage), hemorrhage or the formation of a hematoma (a localized swelling with blood that results from a break in a blood vessel) in the penis or scrotum may result.

However, there are some risks associated with vacuum therapy. It is important that you understand these risks. READ AND UNDERSTAND THE INSTRUCTIONS COMPLETELY (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ALL PRECAUTIONS AND WARNINGS) PRIOR TO USING THE FLESHPUMP. VACUUM THERAPY RISKS & WARNINGS: Do not use any electrically-powered vacuum pump in or near water. Severe bruising or damage to your penis may result if you do not wait at least 60 minutes between uses of the FleshPump. If you use too much vacuum pressure, harm to your penis may result, including without limitation bruising or injury to your penis or scrotum. Apply only the minimum of vacuum pressure necessary to achieve an erection. It is possible that vacuum therapy may cause a small blood blister on the head of your penis. This is normal and should not be harmful. Use of the FleshPump may aggravate pre-existing conditions such as priapism (a persistent, generally painful erection as a consequence of disease and not related to sexual arousal); PeyronieÃ¢ÂÂs disease (the formation of hardened tissue in the penis that causes pain, curvature, and/or distortion, usually during an erection); and urethral strictures (an area of hardened tissue, which narrows the urethra sometimes making it difficult to urinate). Use of the FleshPump may mask an underlying cause of your impotence. These causes may include: diabetes, multiple sclerosis, chronic kidney failure, cirrhosis of the liver, or alcoholism.
