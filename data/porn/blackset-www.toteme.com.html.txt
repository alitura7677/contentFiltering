I hope you all like east european girls, because that's what I am. I'm from a small town called Brno, it's very pretty and I have great memories of my childhood there. When I was 17 I decided I wanted to become a model. At first my parents weren't sure but when I started to make good money they didn't seem to mind. I like modelling for all sorts of stuff. I do fashion shows, catalogue magazines and of course, some sexier stuff! I really don't mind being naked in front of a camera, it has made me a less shy person and now I have the confidence to do whatever I want! AdelineYou might think that life's boring in that tiny little European country but, believe me, it's not. Of course most of the guys over here are bankers, traders but at night those buddies become some of the most exciting people I've met. They love to party and to spend their nights and their money with good looking and open-minded chicks like me. That's why I can't imagine living anywhere else. Cool days and heady nights... AdrianaListen carefully guys from behind the screen. We are nothing but a small part of the universe. No more than a bunch of bipeds trying to be different from each other, to lead the best life we can get. No matter how many happy and sad moments we get. Our existence is so short that we shouldn't care about details. Why did I become a VirtuaGirl ? ..To relax and bring as many people as possible with me on the road of frivolity. Adriana MThe other day I was with a bunch of sexy guys trying to seduce me. I have to say that they were all very appealing to me. Thought they wanted me to say which one of them was the sexiest. It was really nice and funny cause they were all trying to be nicer and sexier than the others and I was making it even more difficult for them, pretending not to be so excited or seduced. I finally said that I would invite the 10 of them to my place to play a little game. They all came! Why choose when you can have it all! AgnesHello boys! I'm very happy to be here and I hope we're gonna have some fun together. I'm from the bonny Scotland and I hope to teach you guys a thing or two about Scottish women! Firstly, we're fiery redheads who know how to drive men crazy and we love making out, so if you're sitting comfortably, then let's begin... Aimee SweetI was born in Providence, Rhode Island where I spent my first 19 years. It was there that I developed a taste for performing for people on the stage and on the field. I moved to California right after my 19th birthday and fell in love with all the beautiful people and places. I met Suze Randall in August of 1997 and she is the one I credit with my success. I really love being in front of the camera and plan to further my career as model and actress! AlanisI'm so happy to live in a town lying just near the mountains and by the sea. The perfect location, especially during the summer when guys from all around Europe come over to spend their summer holidays. I then spend hours on the beach watching and choosing my next prey. The great thing about the beach is that, only wearing swimsuits, men just can't hide and have to let us see and admire the most interesting parts of their bodies... AlexandraIreland might be a small country with a small population but it's definitely a great place. Here people just love to go out, drink a couple of beers with friends. That's why I recently decided to open 'The Bimbo Club'. Each evening, loads of guys from all over Ireland come over here to see me jump on the stage and strip for them. By now, most of them can tell you that I'm a real red hair chick. Wanna see by yourself ? AlexiaHave ever spend a summer in my hometown ? You should 'cause Barcelona is definitely one of the hottest place round the world. In fact, people are really open-minded and nobody will judge you at first sight. Thanks to the weather, hot and sunny, girls always wear very short clothes...sounds like paradise to you boy ? Can easily understand that 'cause, even if I perfer strong dudes, I really enjoy sharing my bed with a young, hot and cute chick... AlyssaI was born 23 years ago in Pisa one of the most beautiful town in Europe. You sure have heard about its tower and all the other historic monuments! But did you know about all the cuties you can meet there? We are very Mediterranean chicks: loud, jealous but, at the same time, so hot and sexy, ready for new experiences, with an insatiable appetite for pleasure. We're just like Italian food: spicy and always surprising. Amber MichaelsHey guys, it's Amber here, how y'all doing? I was born in a small town in Germany but was raised in Miami, Florida. I love tatooes and piercings! I have an Ankh tattoo behind my neck, a Scorpion tattoo on my pussy, and a pierced clit and belly button, yeah the guys love that!! I love meeting my fans, working out, hiking, camping, cooking, dancing and, of course, SEX is my favorite of all hobbies ! AmbraEver pop to Quebec, the French speaking part of Canada? Should come over 'cause it's one of the most exciting place in North America. In fact, like me, girls are really men addicted, always ready to experience new things. In fact, for example, I've never seen so many swapping clubs in any other place. It's as if people are real sex maniacs. I find it rather cool! Don't you?? AnabellaPeople are usually surprised when I tell them that I'm a professional gogo dancer. Men pretend not to understand how a cute and shy girl like me can get naked in front of a bunch of excited guys, paying to watch and touch me. Women pretend to be disgusted. They 'wouldn't do it for a million dollars'! What a laugh. I'm simply doing it because I love it. I love to strip and simply love to be touched by horny men and...women!! AnastasiaWanna know what makes Russian babes different from other girls? As you can see, we've got all the requested physical gifts that men are looking for. Besides, life is so difficult around here that we've learned to cope with it and we've become real manipulators. Still, we're so greedy that guys I've met have always loved it, and I'm sure you will too. Why? 'cause I'm the one you've been looking for. So let me be your thing, your private toy ! AndreaI'm pretty shy with guys when I start dating them, but if I like them and get to know them better, I usually turn into this wild animal, just dying for hot action every night. I can't get enough of a good thing I suppose. I like men who know how to treat a lady, but sometimes I like being treated like a bad girl, it really turns me on, and the guy always loves to think he's the boss. I don't mind once he's a good lover, he can do whatever he wants! AngelI suppose you've all heard about BogotÃ¡. It's one of the most exiting places in South America. Come and join me and my friends and we'll show you its trendy nightclubs. That's usually where I go when I'm here. I then bring back some friends home and, after a quick shower and breakfast, we all go in my bedroom and play erotic games. There are usually more guys than girls 'cause we're so greedy that they need 'substitutes' and we don't ! AngelaMy parents left Ukraine when I was a baby and settled here in Sydney 20 years ago. I've spent most of my childhood on the beaches surrounding my neighborhood, swimming, surfing and sunbathing with my buddies. My parents kept on telling me that I should study instead of wasting my time on the beach but I quickly realized that my sexy figure would be my 'winning card'. That was a risky bet but I'm finally successful. Like it ? Angela Michelle Life is really exciting. A couple of years ago, when I was still a shy student, I wouldn't have thought that I'd become a very successful stripper here in Europe. If you check my pictures, you'll understand why my body usually gives guys a blow. Though, I'm sure that my spirit, the way I see life, the Swedish way, is the main reason why you guys all want to share a bit of intimacy with me... No problem at all. I have a lot to give. Angelica As one of my American friends says, there's something special about French girls. Of course we look good and sexy but we're also sometimes a bit nasty. Every summer we're topless on the beach, knowing perfectly that guys are watching us, getting horny with the little G-string bikini we still have on... But don't think we're easy cause we're not. Though, if you catch us you won't regret it!! Angel CassidyHi, I'm Angel and I've modelled for only the biggest and best in the industry. Playboy, Penthouse, Hustler and now VirtuaGirl, it's so exciting! I have enjoyed working for the biggest companies in the world. I love being sexual and have enjoyed my life exploring all my fantasies! I had a great time shooting with the VirtuaGirl team, they're so professional and pretty cute too. Enjoy my animations, photos and videos boys, I'm all yours! AngieI was born on a corn farm in the deep Middle West. I really discovered the real world when I went to university. See, the other day, a friend invited me to a basketball match to meet her good-looking boy friend who's playing in the team. And it happened to be a great idea. At the end of the match, we went to the locker room to meet that friend. Oh my god! A whole bunch of sexy dudes! They were so welcoming that I even took a shower with them. AnitaMost people think you need to fly to hot and exotic countries to meet real exciting people...that's a real huge mistake ! Believe me, if you come to my place, you'll quickly discover that me and my girlfriends must be some of the most 'hungry for love' kind of chick you've ever seen. And that's why guys from all over Europe come over here every summer... and that's real cool 'cause we're always interested in new experiences...well ,in fact, I am ! AnnaThe other I went to one of best former college friend who was celebrating her birthday. I have to say that I will remember that day. In fact, we were the only two girls and the rest of the 21 guests were guys, and very good looking ones. The beginning of the party was quite funny cause everybody was so shy. But, after an hour things began to turn the way we all expected if you see what I mean... I'm sure you know what I mean!! Anna Marie GoddardI was born and raised in a small farming village in Holland, named Ysbrechtum. But my career in modelling has brought me to Los Angeles where I've modelled for Playboy, starred in 'Ausin Powers 3' and 'Baywatch' and hosted 'Real TV' among others. I've been on cinema screens, TV screens and now computer screens! This time I'm stripping just for you guys with VirtuaGirl2! AprilHi, I'm April. I heard you guys in VirtuaGirl were really cool so I hope we're gonna have a lot of fun together! I'm ready to strip and fullfill all your most wiked desires, just ask me nicely and your wish is my command. You won't be dissapointed, believe me.. Aria GiovanniI was born in the state of California, USA. My nationality is an interesting mix including Italian, Yugoslavian, French, German, Irish, and American Indian. I love being a model because I get to travel all over the world and be treated like a goddess by men everywhere. I can't seem to find the right guy though..maybe me and you could get to know each other better? ArielCrying wolves!! Here they come, hungry and ready to bite! In literature, movies, in everyday life, wolves are everywhere. Men are full of their own ambition and pride. They usually show their guns instead of their guts! Where shall we, women, find enough room for ourselves in that crazy mankind. Are we only objects? But things are changing and foxes can bite back. So, tell me now. Who's behind VirtuaGirl wheel? You or me? AshleyKnow what makes my fellow Aussies so different from others? Well, we're straight people! That's why, when I meet a good looking dude who makes me feel horny, I simply 'jump on him' and ask him to be my new lover. I have to admit that it sometimes happen several times in a day... Just can't resist! AsiaTen or twenty years ago, it was not so easy for a girl to make her living with her figure here in Korea. Now things have changed a lot and Korean girls are very popular worlwide. In fact, hiding behind our shy and frail aspect lies, very often, a greedy evil looking for real males and pleasure. Like me, my sisters know very well how to seduce guys and I can garantee you one thing: you'll be bewitched... Aurely'Rome was not built in a day' neither was I. I was kind of a slapper, trying to follow my older brother in his every week night escape. My mother would not let me do but I could feel the urge of freedom growing inside my body and mind. When I turned 18, not only did I become aware of my feminity but I also discovered I could live by myself with no one taking control : male or female. Axelle MuglerI've always loved dancing. That's why I became a pro stripper when only 16. Of course, nobody new I was that young and, of course, nobody complained about what they were seeing. When I turned 18, I was offered the opportunity to be in my first adult movie. Since then I've become one of the most successful actress in Europe. Though, I still enjoy dancing and stripping... especially if I know that all of you guys are watching! Enjoy the show... Â Affiliate program Copyright Â© Totem Entertainment - All Rights Reserved
